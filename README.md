## Requirements and notes:

* To make it easier to process CSVs, you’re free to edit and remove header rows
* You are free to use whatever technology/language/framework/approach that you want
* Please store your code in a git repository - we want to see your commits (i.e. not just a single commit of all code, we’d like to see the evolution of the solution, so commit early and commit often)
* There should be some evidence of testing
* Please include a README file, content to bet determined by you
* Solutions should be all inclusive, with instructions on how to run it
* This challenge should take 3 to 4 hours… please feel free to time box if you can’t complete everything in a reasonable time frame. We will use what you have completed to start out discussions.
